Collectively we have over forty years of experience building state of the art trading systems and software, from market data to market links to broker-based crossing engines. We have worked with some of the largest financial institutions in the world and have a proven track record of success. We specialize in highly reliable, fault tolerant systems, and we measure our latencies in single-digit microseconds.
